### Description

Due to certain historical practices like redlining, location data (especially zip codes) within the United States can be correlated with demographic information such as race and/or ethnicity. In certain domains (e.g., in hiring or the lending industry), such demographic traits may be considered protected by law. With spatial fairness, we aim to ensure no discrimination occurs with respect to these legally protected attributes in decision-making scenarios where location is central to the task at hand.
